# Hello

I've made the decision to stop hosting services.

This is intended as a developer release, and I will not be including a guide for setup. If you are a developer, this project was developed with Laravel, and their resources are likely the best starting place for testing this project. While creating it, I mainly used Homestead with Vagrant and not Docker. I will not be accepting pull requests or managing issues in this repository.
