# Hello

I've made the decision to stop hosting services.

This is intended as a developer release, and I will not be including a guide for setup. If you're a developer who is familiar with Laravel, their resources are probably the best starting place. When developing it, I mainly used Homestead with Vagrant and not Docker. I will not be accepting pull requests or managing issues in this repository. 

There were users who visited everyday, even at the end. My efforts have already entertained and frustrated others for more time than required from me. If viewing this this release as a challenge, there is likely so much untapped potential in correcting my mistakes to create the platform that should have existed.

I hope you have fun
